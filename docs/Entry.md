I can certainly provide a detailed breakdown of the **MERL Linker Records** (the "refactoring stuff"). These entries are the heart of the MERL format, containing all the information the MIPS loader needs to resolve addresses and create a single, executable program from multiple modules.

Here is a detailed look at the data structure for the **REL**, **ESR**, and **ESD** entries.

***

## MERL Linker Records: Structure and Detail ðŸ§©

The Linker Records section begins immediately after the code section, as indicated by the **End of Code** field in the MERL header. The records are processed sequentially until the **End of Module** is reached.

### 1. REL Entry (Relocation)

The **REL** entry handles **local references**. It's the simplest entry, consisting only of the marker followed by a list of 32-bit offsets.

| Field Name | Size (Words) | Hex Marker | Value / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marker** | 1 | `0x00000001` | Identifies the start of a relocation record block. |
| **Offset List** | Variable | N/A | A list of **32-bit offsets** (relative to the start of the code section, Offset `0x0C`). |

**How the Loader Uses It:**

The loader iterates through the `Offset List`. For each offset $O$, it performs the following patch:
$$\text{Code}[O] = \text{Code}[O] + \text{Module\_Load\_Address}$$

This fixes the placeholder in the code section by adding the absolute memory address where the module was loaded, correctly pointing the instruction (usually `lis / .word`) to the right place in memory.

### 2. ESR Entry (External Symbol Reference)

The **ESR** entry handles **external symbol imports** (`.import`). It tells the loader that the current module needs the address of a symbol defined elsewhere. This record includes the symbol's name as a sequence of ASCII words.

| Field Name | Size (Words) | Hex Marker | Value / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marker** | 1 | `0x00000011` | Identifies the start of an External Symbol Reference block. |
| **Code Offset** | 1 | N/A | The offset to the **`.word` placeholder** in the code section that needs to be patched (e.g., the address of `.word foo`). |
| **Symbol Length** | 1 | N/A | The number of characters in the symbol name. |
| **Symbol Name** | $L$ | N/A | The actual symbol name, stored as $L$ words, one ASCII character per word. |

**Structure Example (Reference to symbol "bar"):**

| Offset | Content | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0x3C` | `00000011` | **ESR Marker** |
| `0x40` | `00000020` | **Code Offset** (e.g., the address of `.word bar`) |
| `0x44` | `00000003` | **Symbol Length** (3 characters) |
| `0x48` | `00000062` | ASCII 'b' |
| `0x4C` | `00000061` | ASCII 'a' |
| `0x50` | `00000072` | ASCII 'r' |

### 3. ESD Entry (Exported Symbol Definition)

The **ESD** entry handles **external symbol exports** (`.export`). It advertises the address of a symbol defined within the current module, making it available for other modules to import.

| Field Name | Size (Words) | Hex Marker | Value / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marker** | 1 | `0x00000005` | Identifies the start of an Exported Symbol Definition block. |
| **Code Offset** | 1 | N/A | The offset of the **symbol's definition** (e.g., the address of `funcA:` or `data: .word 0`). |
| **Symbol Length** | 1 | N/A | The number of characters in the symbol name. |
| **Symbol Name** | $L$ | N/A | The actual symbol name, stored as $L$ words, one ASCII character per word. |

**Structure Example (Definition of symbol "funcA"):**

| Offset | Content | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0x60` | `00000005` | **ESD Marker** |
| `0x64` | `0000000C` | **Code Offset** (The `funcA:` label starts at this offset) |
| `0x68` | `00000005` | **Symbol Length** (5 characters) |
| `0x6C` | `00000066` | ASCII 'f' |
| `0x70` | `00000075` | ASCII 'u' |
| `0x74` | `0000006E` | ASCII 'n' |
| `0x78` | `00000063` | ASCII 'c' |
| `0x7C` | `00000041` | ASCII 'A' |

### Refactoring Logic Summary

| Record Type | What it Patches | How it Gets the Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REL** | The current module's code. | **Calculates** the address using the module's load address. |
| **ESR** | The current module's code. | **Looks up** the address from the global symbol table (built from **ESD** records). |
| **ESD** | Global Symbol Table. | **Provides** the address (Offset + Module Load Address) for other modules to use. |
